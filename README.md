## 📚 Project Overview

This notebook takes you through the entire NLP pipeline from preprocessing to model evaluation:

### 🔍 Topics Covered:
- **Text Cleaning and Normalization**
- **Tokenization** (word and sentence-level)
- **Stopword Removal**
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging** using NLTK and spaCy
- **TF-IDF Feature Extraction**
- **Text Classification** using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

📈 **Achieved Model Accuracy: ~85%**
